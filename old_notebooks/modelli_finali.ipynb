    "The power of the tree can be tuned with the following constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **max_depth**: The maximum depth of the tree. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **min_samples_split**: The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node\n",
    "\n",
    "- **min_samples_leaf**: The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **max_leaf_nodes**: The maximum number of trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **min_impurity_decrease**: The minimum gain for allowing a split.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **min_impurity_split**: The minim error for allowing a split.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conjunction with the above constraints most implementations implement a smarter growing strategy. \n",
    "Indeed, if we are limited in the number of nodes, then growing order makes a difference.\n",
    "In this case, it is useful to evaluate the gain provided by splitting all of the tree leaves, and \n",
    "then split the leaf the provides the maximum gain.\n",
